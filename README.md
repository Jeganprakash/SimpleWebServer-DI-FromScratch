# SimpleWebServer-DI-FromScratch
# Minimalist Web Server Implementation

Welcome to the Minimalist Web Server repository! This project is a from-scratch implementation of a web server, devoid of external libraries to emphasize simplicity and facilitate a deep understanding of web server development fundamentals.

## Key Features

### Dependency Injection (DI)

Discover a basic yet effective implementation of dependency injection within the web server architecture. Learn how to manage and inject dependencies without relying on external DI libraries, gaining insights into building modular and extensible systems.

### Bare-Bones Design

The server is intentionally kept simple to provide a clear understanding of the core concepts involved in building a web server. This minimalist approach serves as a foundation for those interested in delving into the internals of HTTP communication.

### Educational Resource

Crafted with educational purposes in mind, this project is suitable for both beginners aiming to grasp the basics of web server development and experienced developers seeking insights into dependency injection. Fork, clone, and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding of web server development.
